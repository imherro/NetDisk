        <note>
            The outbound-rule specifies that when response.encodeURL is called (if you are using JSTL c:url) the url /rewrite-status will be rewritten to /test/status/. The above rule and this outbound-rule means that end users should never see the url /rewrite-status only /test/status/ both in thier location bar and in hyperlinks in your pages.
